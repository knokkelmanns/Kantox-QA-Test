**Requirements review**\
Before we start creating test cases, we need to analyze the requirements. And there is exist some questions.
- First rule. Should it apply to one type of product or not? If not, which product should be free if we add different ones? How should we decide which product should be free (cheaper or with higher cost)? If it relates to one type of product, we need to document that.
- Second rule. Should it apply to one type of product or not? Document this after elaboration.
- Third rule. Does it apply for one type of product or to the total Cart amount? Document this after elaboration.
